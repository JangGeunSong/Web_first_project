# Web_first_project
This is just my own homepages basic form that will be added.

This repository has added the my page basic form and after few weeks i will upload the page source and JS source with node.js as a web server

I made this project static server side web application. So, I will make the dynamic server side project on this side.

ver 0.4 ------ <1/17/2019>: Add the node.js system on the web page.

ver 0.6 ------ <1/23/2019>: set the dynamic sever side implementation by using node js. now i will add some update method on the application.

express example added that will delete as complete the project
